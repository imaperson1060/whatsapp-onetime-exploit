# whatsapp single view images exploit
 an exploit to save whatsapp single view images

## important
this violates whatsapp's terms of service, so your account will be at risk of being banned (probably won't happen though)


## setup
- install [node](https://nodejs.dev)
- run `npm install` in the project directory
- run `node .`

## usage
- when prompted, scan the qr code in the terminal with the whatsapp "linked devices" menu
- wait for the terminal to acknowledge the connection, and then send a single view photo on a chat with the automated account
- reply to the single view photo with <span style="color: #ce9178">"!view"</span>
- the automated account will reply to your message with the original image, without sending a read receipt
